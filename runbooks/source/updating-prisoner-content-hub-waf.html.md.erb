# Updating Prisoner Content Hub WAF

Every so often the Prisoner Content Hub require their WAF IP allowlist updating. This is a bespoke job and not fully #gitops

> Note: When adding an IP range e.g. `/28` it must start with the first address in the range. `10.0.0.50/28` is not valid however `10.0.0.48/28` is since it's the start of the block.

1. Log in to AWS Console
2. Goto Parameter Store - ensure you're in eu-west-2
3. Search for "prisoner"
4. Select the correct `ip-allow-list` parameter store (per environment)
5. Add or remove the IP address from the JSON object and save
6. Log in to Concourse
7. Run the `infrastructure-account` plan pipeline - you should see the `aws_wafv2_ip_set` have pending updates
8. Run the `infrastructure-account` apply pipeline
9. Confirm the changes by going to WAF & Shield, select Web ACLs, click on the correct environment, select Rules and search for the IP address.
