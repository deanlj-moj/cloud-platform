# Incident on 2024-04-15 - Prometheus restarted during WAL reload several times which resulted in missing metrics

- **Key events**
  - First detected: 2024-04-15 12:32
  - Incident declared: 2024-04-15 14.43
  - Repaired: 2024-04-15 15:53
  - Resolved 2024-04-18 16:13

- **Time to repair**: 3h 21m

- **Time to resolve**: 21h 20m

- **Identified**: Team observed that the prometheus pod was restarted several times after a planned prometheus change

- **Impact**: Prometheus is not Available. The Cloud Platform lose the monitoring for a period of time.

- **Context**:
  - 2024-04-15 12:32: Prometheus was not available after a planned change
  - 2024-04-15 12:52: Found that the WAL reload was not completing and triggering a restart before completing
  - 2024-04-15 13:00: Update send to users about the issue with Prometheus
  - 2024-04-15 12:57: Planned change reverted to exclude that as a root cause but that didnt help
  - 2024-04-15 13:46: Debugged the log shows that startupProbe failed event
  - 2024-04-15 15:21: Increasing the StartupProbe to a higher value to 30 mins. The default is 15 mins
  â€“ 2024-04-15 15:53: Applied the change to increase startupProbe, Prometheus has become available, Incident repaired
  - 2024-04-15 16:00: Users updated with the Prometheus Status
  - 2024-04-18 16:13: Team identified the reason for the longer WAL reload and recorded findings, Incident Resolved.

- **Resolution**:
  - During the planning restart, the WAL count of Prometheus was higher and hence the reload takes too much time that the default startupProbe was not enough
  - Increasing the startupProbe threshold allowed the WAL reload to complete

- **Review actions**:
  - Team discussed about performing planned prometheus restarts when the WAL count is lower to reduce the restart time
  - The default CPU and Memory requests were set to meet the maximum usage
  - Create a test setup to recreate live WAL count
  - Explore memory-snapshot-on-shutdown and auto-gomaxprocs feature flag options
  - Explore remote storage of WAL files to a different location
  - Look into creating a blue-green prometheus to have live like setup to test changes before applying to live
  - Spike into Amazon Managed Prometheus
