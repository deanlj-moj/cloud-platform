- **Impact**: Prometheus is not Available. The Cloud Platform lose the monitoring for a period of time.

- **Context**:
  - 2023-11-01 10:15: PagerDuty High Priority alert from Pingdom that Prometheus - live healthcheck is DOWN. Team acknowledged and checked the state of the Prometheus server.
  - 2023-11-01 10:41: PagerDuty for Prometheus alerted 3rd time in a row in just few minutes interval. Incident declared
  - 2023-11-01 10:41: Prometheus pod has restarted and the prometheus container is starting
  - 2023-11-01 10:41: Prometheus logs shows there are numerous Evaluation rule failed
  - 2023-11-01 10:41: Events in monitoring namespace recorded Readiness Probe failed for Prometheus
  - 2023-11-01 12:35: Team enabled debug log level for prometheus to understand the issue
  - 2023-11-03 16:01: After investigating the logs, team found that one possible root cause might be the readiness Probe failure prior to the restart of prometheus. Hence team increased the readiness probe timeout
  - 2023-11-03 16:01: Incident repaired and resolved.

- **Resolution**:
  - Team identified that the readiness probe was failing and the prometheus was restarted.
  - Increased the readiness probe timeout from 3 to 6 seconds to avoid the restart of prometheus

- **Review actions**:
  - Team discussed about having closer inspection and try to identify these kind of failures earlier
  - Investigate if the ingestion of data to the database too big or long
  - Is executing some queries make prometheus work harder and stop responding to the readiness probe
  - Any other services which is probing prometheus that triggers the restart
  - Is taking regular velero backups distrub the ebs read/write and cause the restart
