# Incident on 2022-01-22 - some DNS records got deleted at the weekend

- **Key events**
  - First detected 2022-01-22 11:57
  - Incident declared 2022-01-22 14:41
  - Repaired 2022-01-22 13:59
  - Resolved 2022-01-22 14:38

- **Time to repair**: 2h 2m

- **Time to resolve**: 2h 41m

- **Identified**: Pingdom alerted an LAA developer to some of their sites becoming unavailable. They reported this to CP team via Slack #ask-cloud-platform, and the messages were spotted by on-call engineers

- **Impact**:
  - Sites affected:
    - 2 production sites were unavailable:
      - laa-fee-calculator-production.apps.live-1.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk
      - legal-framework-api.apps.live-1.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk
    - 3 production sites had minor issues - unavailable on domains that only MOJ staff use
    - 46 non-production sites were unavailable on domains that only MOJ staff use
  - Impact on users was negligible. The 2 sites that external users would have experienced the unavailability are typically used by office staff, for generally non-urgent work, whereas this incident occurred during the weekend.

- **Context**:
  - Timeline: [Timeline](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TXxdb1iOqfW_Vo2HhiGC3LFE-0jEP_hDgQn2nuP1VdM/edit#) for the incident
  - Slack thread: [Slack thread](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C57UPMZLY/p1642855796441900) for the incident.

- **Resolution**:
  - external-dns was trying to restore the DNS records, but it was receiving errors when writing, due to missing annotations (external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/aws-weight) in an unrelated ingress. Manually adding the annotations restored the DNS.

- **Review actions**:
  - Create guidance about internal traffic and domain names, and advertise to users in slack [#3497](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform/issues/3497)
  - Create pingdom alerts for test helloworld apps [#3498](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform/issues/3498)
  - Investigate if external-dns sync functionality is enough for the DNS cleanup [#3499](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform/issues/3499)
  - Change the ErrorsInExternalDNS alarm to high priority [#3500](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform/issues/3500)
  - Create a runbook to handle ErrorsInExternalDNS alarm [#3501](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform/issues/3501)
  - Assign someone to be the 'hammer' on Fridays
