# Incident on 2020-08-25 - Connectivity issues with eu-west-2a

- **Key events**
  - First detected 2020-08-25 11:01
  - Incident declared 2020-08-25 11:26
  - Resolved 2020-08-25 12:11

- **Time to repair**: 0h 45m

- **Time to resolve**: 1h 10m

- **Identified**: The AWS  Availability Zones `eu-west-2a`, which contain some of our kubernetes nodes had an outage. API latency was elevated, some EC2 became unreachable and overall connectivity was unstable.

- **Impact**:
  - Two kubernetes nodes became unreachable
  - No new node could be launched in eu-west-2a
  - Kubernetes had issues talking to some of these nodes, preventing some API calls to succeed (Pods were not terminating)
  - New pods were not able to pull their Docker images.

- **Context**:
  - Pods and Nodes sitting in other Availability Zones (b & c) were not impacted
  - Slack threads: [Issue detected](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C514ETYJX/p1598351210195200), [Incident Declared](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C514ETYJX/p1598351210195200),
  - We now have 25 pods in the cluster, instead of 21

- **Resolution**:
    The incident was mitigated by deploying more 2-4 nodes in healthy Availability Zones, manually deleting the non-responding pods, and terminating the impacted nodes
