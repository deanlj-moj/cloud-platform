# Incident on 2021-07-12 - All ingress resources using *apps.live-1 domain names stop working

- **Key events**
  - First detected 2021-07-12 15:44
  - Repaired 2021-07-12 15:51
  - Incident declared 2021-07-12 16:09
  - Resolved 2021-07-13 11:49

- **Time to repair**: 0h 07m

- **Time to resolve**: 20h 03m

- **Identified**: User reported in #ask-cloud-platform an error from the APM monitoring platform Sentry:
```Hostname/IP does not match certificate's altnames```

- **Impact**: All ingress resources using the *apps.live-1.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk have mismatched certificates.

- **Context**:
  - Occurred immediately following an upgrade to the default certificate of "live" clusters (PR here: https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-terraform-ingress-controller/pull/20)
  - The change amended the default certificate in the `live-1` cluster to `*.apps.manager.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk`.

  - Slack thread: [#ask-cloud-platform](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C57UPMZLY/p1626101058045600) for the incident, [#cloud-platform](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C514ETYJX/p1626173354336900?thread_ts=1626101869.307700&cid=C514ETYJX) for the recovery.

- **Resolution**:
  - The immediate repair was simple: perform an inline edit of the default certificate in `live-1`. Replacing the word `manager` with `live-1` i.e. reverting the faulty change.
  - Further investigation ensued, finding the cause of the incident was actually an underlying bug in the infrastructure apply pipeline used to perform a `terraform apply` against manager.
  - This bug had been around from the creation of the pipeline but had never surfaced.
  - The pipeline uses an environment variable named `KUBE_CTX` to context switch between clusters. This works for resources using the `terraform provider`, however, not for `null_resources`, causing the change in the above PR to apply to the wrong cluster.

- **Review actions**:
  - Provide guidance on namespace to namespace traffic - using network policy not ingress (and advertise it to users) Ticker [#3082](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform/issues/3082)
  - Monitoring the cert - Kubehealthy monitor key things including cert. Could replace several of the integration tests that take longer. Ticket [#3044](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform/issues/3044)
  - Canary app should have #high-priority-alerts after 2 minutes if it goes down. DONE in [PR #5126](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-environments/pull/5126)
  - Fix the pipeline: in the [cloud-platform-cli](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-cli), create an assertion to ensure the cluster name is equal to the terraform workspace name. To prevent the null-resources acting on the wrong cluster. PR exists
  - Created a [ticket](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform/issues/3084) to migrate all terraform null_resources within our modules to [terraform kubectl provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/gavinbunney/kubectl/latest/docs)
  - Created a [ticket](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform/issues/3083) to set terraform kubernetes credentials dynamically (at executing time)
  - Fix the pipeline: Before the creation of Terraform resources, add a function in the cli to perform a `kubectl context` switch to the correct cluster. PR exists
