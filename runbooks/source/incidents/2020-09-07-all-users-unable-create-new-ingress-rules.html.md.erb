# Incident on 2020-09-07 - All users are unable to create new ingress rules

- **Key events**
  - First detected 2020-09-07 12:39
  - Incident declared 2020-09-07 12:54
  - Resolved 2020-09-07 15:56

- **Time to repair**: 3h 02m

- **Time to resolve**: 3h 17m

- **Identified**: The Ingress API refused 100% of POST requests.

- **Impact**:
  - If a user were to provision a new service, they would be unable to create an ingress into the cluster.

- **Context**:
  - [Version 0.1.0](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-terraform-teams-ingress-controller/compare/0.0.9...0.1.0) of the [teams ingress controller module](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-terraform-teams-ingress-controller) enabled the creation of a `validationwebhookconfiguration` resource.
  - By enabling this option we created a single point of failure for all ingress-controller pods in the `ingress-controller` namespace.
  - A new 0.1.0 ingress controller failed to create in the "live-1" cluster due to AWS resource limits.
  - Validation webhook stopped new rules from creating, with the error:
    ```
    Error from server (InternalError): error when creating "ingress.yaml": Internal error occurred: failed calling webhook "validate.nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io": Post offender-categorisation-prod-nx-controller-admission.ingress-controllers.svc:443/extensions/v1beta1/ingresses?timeout=30s: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority
    ```

  - Incident declared: https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C514ETYJX/p1599479640251900

- **Resolution**:
    The team manually removed the all the additional admission controllers created by 0.1.0. They then removed the admission webhook from the module and created a new release (0.1.1). All ingress modules currently on 0.1.0 were upgraded to the new release 0.1.1.
