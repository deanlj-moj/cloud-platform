# Incident on 2020-08-07 - Master node provisioning failure

- **Key events**
  - First detected 2020-08-07 15:51
  - Repaired 2020-08-07 16:29
  - Incident declared 2020-08-07 16:39
  - Resolved 2020-08-14 10:06

- **Time to repair**: 0h 38m

- **Time to resolve**: 33h 15m (during support hours 10:00-17:00 M-F)

- **Identified**: Routine replacement of a master node failed because AWS did not have any c4.4xlarge instances available in the relevant availability zone.

- **Impact**:
  - Increased risk because the cluster was running on 2 out of 3 master nodes, for a brief period

- **Context**:
  - Lack of availability of a given instance type is not a failure mode for which we have planned
  - In theory, if a problem occurs which eventually kills each master node in turn, and if instances of the right type are not available in at least 2 availability zones, this could bring down the whole cluster.

- **Resolution**:
  - A new c4.4xlarge node *was* successfully (and automatically) launched approx. 40 minutes after we saw the problem
  - We replaced all our master nodes with c5.4xlarge instances, which (currently) have better availability
  - We and AWS are still investigating longer-term and more reliable fixes
