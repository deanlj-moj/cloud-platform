- **Context**:
  - Although the Prometheus URL was unreachable, Grafana and Alertmanager were resolving.
  - There seemed to be an issue preventing requests to reach the prometheus pods.
  - Disk space and other resources, the usual suspects, were ruled out as the cause.
  - The domain name amd ingress were both valid.
