# Incident on 2023-01-05 - CircleCI Security Incident

- **Key events**
  - First detected 2023-01-04 (Time TBC)
  - Incident declared: 2022-01-05 08:56
  - Repaired 2023-02-01 10:30
  - Resolved 2022-02-01 10:30

- **Time to repair**: 673h 34m

- **Time to resolve**: 673h 34m

- **Identified**: CircleCI announced a [security alert on 4th January 2023](https://circleci.com/blog/january-4-2023-security-alert/). Their advice was for any and all secrets stored in CircleCI to be rotated immediately as a cautionary measure.

- **Impact**: Exposure of secrets stored within CircleCI for running various services associated with applications running on the Cloud Platform.

- **Context**: Users of the Cloud Platform use CircleCI for CI/CD including deployments into the Cloud Platform. Access for CircleCI into the Cloud Platform is granted by generating a namespace enclosed service-account with required permission set by individual teams/users.
As all service-account access/permissions were set based on user need, some service-accounts had access to all stored secrets within the namespace it was created in.
As part of our preliminary investigation, it was also discovered service-accounts were shared between namespaces which exposed this incident wider than first anticipated.
We made the decision that we need to rotate any and all secrets used within the cluster.

- **Resolution**: Due to the unknown nature opf some of the secrets that may have been exposed a prioritised phased approach was created:
  - Phase 1
    Rotate the secret access key all service-accounts named “circle-*”
    Rotate the secret access key for all other service-accounts
    Rotate all IRSA service-accounts

  - Phase 2
    Rotate all AWS keys within namespaces which had a CircleCI service-account

  - Phase 3
    Rotate all AWS keys within all other namespaces not in Phase 2

  - Phase 4
    Create and publish guidance for users to rotate all other secrets within namespaces and AWS keys generated via a Cloud Platform Module

  - Phase 5
    Clean up any other IAM/Access keys not managed via code within the AWS account.

Full detailed breakdown of events can be found in the [postmortem notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HQXzLtiXorRIcyt8YdBu24ZSZqNAFrXVhSSIAy3242A/edit?usp=sharing).

- **Review actions**:
  - Implement Trivy scanning for container vulnerability (Done)
  - Implement Secrets Manager
  - Propose more code to be managed in cloud-platform-environments repository
  - Look into a Terraform resource for CircleCI
  - Use IRSA instead of AWS Keys
