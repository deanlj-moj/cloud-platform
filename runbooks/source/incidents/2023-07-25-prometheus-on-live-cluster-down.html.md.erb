- **Time to repair**: 1h 50m

- **Time to resolve**: 1h 50m

- **Identified**: [PagerDuty High Priority alert from Pingdom that Prometheus - live healthcheck is DOWN](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C8PF51AT0/p1690290348206639)

- **Impact**: Prometheus is not Available. The Cloud Platform lose the monitoring for a period of time.

- **Context**:
  - 2023-07-25 14:05 - PagerDuty High Priority alert from Pingdom that Prometheus - live healthcheck is DOWN. Team acknowledged and checked the state of the Prometheus server. Prometheus errored for Rule evaluation and Exit code 137
  - 2023-07-25 14:09: Prometheus pod is in terminating state
  - 2023-07-25 14:17: The node where prometheus is running went to Not Ready state
  - 2023-07-25 14:22: Drain the monitoring node which moved the prometheus to the another monitoring node
  - 2023-07-25 14:56: After moving to new node the prometheus restarted just after coming back and put the node to Node Ready State
  - 2023-07-25 15:11: Comms went to cloud-platform-update on Prometheus was DOWN
  - 2023-07-25 15:20: Team found that the node memory is spiking to 89% and decided to go for a bigger instance size
  - 2023-07-25 15:21: Incident declared. https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C514ETYJX/p1690294889724869
  - 2023-07-25 15:31: Changed the instance size to `r6i.4xlarge`
  - 2023-07-25 15:50: Still the Prometheus restarted after running. Team found the recent prometheus pod was terminated with OOMKilled. Increased the memory limits 100Gi
  - 2023-07-25 16:18: Updated the prometheus container limits:CPU - 12 core and 110 Gi Memory to accommodate the resource need for prometheus
  - 2023-07-25 16:18: Incident repaired
  - 2023-07-05 16:18: Incident resolved

- **Resolution**:
  - Due to increase number of namespaces and prometheus rules, the prometheus server needed more memory. The instance size was not enough to keep the prometheus running.
  - Updating the node type to double the cpu and memory and increasing the container resource limit of prometheus server resolved the issue

- **Review actions**:
  - Add alert to monitor the node memory usage and if a pod is using up most of the node memory [#4538](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform/issues/4538)
