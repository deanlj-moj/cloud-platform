# Incident on 2021-06-09 - All users are unable to create new ingress rules, following bad ModSec Ingress-controller upgrade

- **Key events**
  - First detected 2021-06-09 13:15
  - Repaired 2021-06-09 13:46
  - Incident declared 2020-06-09 13:54
  - Resolved 2021-06-09 13:58

- **Time to repair**: 0h 31m

- **Time to resolve**: 0h 43m

- **Identified**: User reported in #ask-cloud-platform an error when deploying UAT application:
```kind Ingress: Internal error occurred: failed calling webhook "validate.nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io": Post https://modsec01-nx-modsec-admission.ingress-controllers.svc:443/networking/v1beta1/ingresses?timeout=10s: x509: certificate is valid for modsec01-nx-controller-admission, modsec01-nx-controller-admission.ingress-controllers.svc, not modsec01-nx-modsec-admission.ingress-controllers.svc```

- **Impact**: It blocked all ingress API calls, so no new ingresses could be created, nor changes to current ingresses could be deployed, which included all user application deployments.

- **Context**:
  - Occurred immediately following an upgrade to the ModSec Ingress-controller module v3.33.0, which apparently successfully deployed
  - It caused any new ingress or changes to current ingresses to be blocked by the ModSec Validation webhook
  - Timeline: [Timeline](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s5pos29Gcq0ssVnpf0biqG2aE-Kt2PtyxEcpjG88rdc/edit#) for the incident.

- **Resolution**: Rollback to ModSec Ingress-controller module v0.0.7

- **Review actions**:
  - Find out why this issue didnâ€™t get flagged in the test cluster - try to reproduce the issue - maybe need another test? Ticket [#2972](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform/issues/2972)
  - Add test that checks the alerts in alertmanager in smoke tests. Ticket [#2973](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform/issues/2973)
  - Add helloworld app that uses modsec controller, for the smoke tests to check traffic works. Ticket [#2974](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform/issues/2974)
  - Modsec module, new version, needs to be working on EKS for live-1 and live (neither old or new version work on live). Ticket [#2975](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform/issues/2975)
