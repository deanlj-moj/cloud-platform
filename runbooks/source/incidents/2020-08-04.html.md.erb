# Incident on 2020-08-04

- **Key events**
  - Fault occurs 2020-08-04 13:30
  - Fault detected 2020-08-04 18:13
  - Incident declared 2020-08-05 11:04
  - Resolved 2020-08-05 16:16

- **Time to repair**: 5h 8m

- **Time to resolve**: 9h 16m (during support hours 10:00-17:00)

- **Identified**: Integration tests failed for cert-manager, apply pipeline failed showing it doesnot have permissions and
 divergence pipeline shows drift for live-1 components

- **Impact**:
  - Increased risk for cluster failure because some of the components do not have the correct configuration needed for the `live-1` production cluster

- **Context**:
  - One of the engineers was creating a test EKS cluster and ran `terraform apply` on EKS components
  - Without fully aware of the current cluster context, the `terraform apply` for EKS test cluster components has been applied to the `live-1` kops cluster
  - This has changed the configuration of several resources in the `live-1` cluster

- **Resolution**:
    Compare each resource configuration with the terraform state and applied the correct configuration from the code specific to kops cluster
