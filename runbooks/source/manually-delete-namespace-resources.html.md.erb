# Manually Delete Namespace Resources

In the event that you need to manually delete a cloud-platform-environments namespace, for example production namespaces which our
namespace-deleter pipeline is configured to skip, you can do so by following the steps below.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- cloud-platform CLI
- kubectl
- terraform CLI

## Environment Variables

In addition to having your AWS profile configured, the following environment variables must be set before executing a
namespace deletion:

```bash
TF_VAR_cluster_name           # e.g. "cp-1902-02" to get the vpc details for some modules like rds, es
TF_VAR_vpc_name               # e.g. "live-1"
TF_VAR_eks_cluster_name       # e.g. "live"
TF_VAR_cluster_state_bucket   # State where the cluster state is stored
TF_VAR_github_owner           # Github owner: ministryofjustice
TF_VAR_github_token           # Personal access token with repo scope to push github action secrets
TF_VAR_kubernetes_cluster     # Full name of the Cluster e.g. XXXXXX.gr7.eu-west2.eks.amazonaws.com
PINGDOM_API_TOKEN             # API Token to access pingdom
PIPELINE_TERRAFORM_STATE_LOCK_TABLE # DynamoDB table where the state lock is stored
PIPELINE_STATE_BUCKET         # State bucket where the environments state is stored e.g cloud-platform-terraform-state
PIPELINE_STATE_KEY_PREFIX     # State key/ folder where the environments terraform state is stored e.g cloud-platform-environments
PIPELINE_STATE_REGION         # State region of the bucket e.g. eu-west-1
PIPELINE_CLUSTER              # Cluster name/folder inside namespaces/ in cloud-platform-environments
PIPELINE_CLUSTER_STATE        # Cluster name/folder inside the state bucket where the environments terraform state is stored
PIPELINE_CLUSTER_DIR          # e.g. "live.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk"
```

For specific values, you can refer to the [Concourse environments-live pipeline](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-terraform-concourse/blob/main/pipelines/manager/main/environments-live.yaml)
and its associated secrets.

## Deleting a namespace

The `cloud-platform` CLI namespace delete command must be executed from the root of the `cloud-platform-environments` repository. If the
namespace folder still exists in the environments repository (ie no namespace removal PR has been merged), then the command will abort. Therefore
ensure that your environments repository is up to date with the latest changes.

Locate the PR number for the namespace deletion PR, and execute the following command:

```bash
cloud-platform environment destroy \
    --prNumber [namespace-deletion-PR] \
    --cluster arn:aws:eks:eu-west-2:754256621582:cluster/live \
    --kubecfg ~/.kube/config \
    --clusterdir live.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk \
    --skip-prod-destroy=true  # Set this flag to false to destroy namespace marked :is-production
```
The command will then destroy all terraform and kubernetes resources associated with the namespace, and finally will delete
the namespace itself.
