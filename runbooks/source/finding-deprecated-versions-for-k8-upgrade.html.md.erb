### What is deprecated?
  
Kubernetes is a large system with many components and many contributors. As with any such software, the feature set naturally evolves over time, and sometimes a feature may need to be removed. This could include an API, a flag, or even an entire feature. To avoid breaking existing users, Kubernetes follows a deprecation policy for aspects of the system that are slated to be removed.

### Using kubent to find deprecated versions within a cluster for upgrading 

Repository: [kubent](https://github.com/doitintl/kube-no-trouble)

Kubent is a tool that will run against a cluster and create a list showing deprecated components and the namespace they belong to,  that are currently in the cluster and the versions needed to replace them to upgrade the kubernetes version.

The tool is simple to use, follow the [README](https://github.com/doitintl/kube-no-trouble/blob/master/README.md) in the repository linked above
