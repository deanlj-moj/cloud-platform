# Pushing logs to the SOC team
Cloud Platform logs from various sources are being pushed to the SOC team's security monitoring solution `Palo Alto Cortex XSIAM`.

We are currently pushing the following logs:

1. Cloudtrail logs

We are planning to push the following logs in the coming sprints. [Epic found here].

2. `live-1` VPC FlowLogs
3. Route 53 logs
4. EKS logs

## 1. Cloudtrail logs
### Architecture
We have followed Palo Alto's documentation on implementation to allow [Cortex XSIAM to injest logs from Cloudtrail].

Cloudtrail logs are written to a S3 bucket. The implementation consist of enabling the S3 bucket to trigger event notifications to an SQS queue. An IAM user with access keys has been created to grant Cortex XSIAM to accesse the SQS queue and recieves all the log messages. The terraform code for this implementation is found in the [cloud-platform-terraform-infrastructure] repository.

### IAM User access keys rotation
We need put in a mechanism to periodically rotate the IAM User access keys created for Cortex XSIAM to recieve the logs. [Suggestion and issue] for this has been raised.

## 2. VPC FlowLogs

## 3. Route53 logs
