# Recycle-node

The [recycle-node pipeline][recyclenode-pipeline-definition] runs every weekday between 8am and 10am, it executes the [cloud-platform cli][recycle-node-cli] command to replace the oldest worker node by:

* Cordoning the oldest node
* Draining the node
* Force drain to delete the remaining "stuck pods"
* Terminating the node
* Ensure the cluster is healthy with the same set of nodes before the process started

To recycle to oldest node on the cluster in your current context:

    cloud-platform cluster recycle-node --oldest


To recycle a given node on the cluster in your current context

    cloud-platform cluster recycle-node --name ip-XXX.XX.XX.XX.eu-west-2.compute.internal

The other optional flags are 

`--kubecfg <string>`: to specify the path of kubeconfig file (default "~/.kube/config")

`--debug` : enable debug logging

For other flags, refer the help with `--help` flag.
