# Remove data from OpenSearch

This runbook aims to guide you through purging specific logs/data from OpenSearch.

Let's assume in this guide that we are trying to delete all logs of the  `my-namespace-production` namespace, from the 01/02/2025

## Stop the breach first

If you're removing data from OpenSearch, this is presumably because sensitive information has been logged by mistake.
Please ensure that the underlying problem has been fixed, and no more sensitive data is going to be logged by the same
application, before spending time removing what's already there.

## Things to know

An important thing to understand is the difference between an index and a document.
An index contains documents. In our case, documents are log entries.

The current logging strategy is to have one index per day, containing all the daily logs.
All application logs are sent to that daily index, ex:  `live_kubernetes_cluster-2025.02.01`
If you want your query to cover all log data stored in the OpenSearch cluster, you can use an expression like `live_kubernetes_cluster-2*`

Although it is possible to delete a whole index with a curator job, this guide will only cover the deletion of specific documents.

## Get yourself access

Cloud Platform team members have access to the required IAM permissions to carry out the following commands from work devices. You'll just need to authenticate as usual with `aws sso login`

We'll be making use of `curl` and [AWS Sigv4](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_sigv.html) to authenticate our requests to OpenSearch. You can take a look at this [guide](https://code.dblock.org/2022/07/11/making-sigv4-authenticated-requests-to-managed-opensearch.html) on how to build `curl` requests. Alternatively, you can install [awscurl](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/awscurl), which provides a wrapper around `curl` that handles the signing for you. We'll use this for snippets below.

## Build your query

It is possible to reuse the body of a `search` query for a `delete` query.

Therefore, if we narrow down a search query to exactly what we want to delete, we've done most of the work.

OpenSearch offers a [webconsole](https://app-logs.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/_dashboards/app/dev_tools#/console) to test queries.

A standard query is :

```
GET /live_kubernetes_cluster-2025.02.01/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "kubernetes.namespace_name.keyword": "my-namespace-production"
    }
  }
}
```

> Important note: `.keyword` forces OpenSearch to only return exact matches. Without it, you may end up deleting more than you wish

As an `awscurl` command, the query above would translate to:

```
awscurl --service es \
  --region eu-west-2 \
  -XGET "https://search-cp-live-app-logs-jywwr7het3xzoh5t7ajar4ho3m.eu-west-2.es.amazonaws.com/live_kubernetes_cluster-2025.02.01/_search" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "query": {
      "match": {
        "kubernetes.namespace_name.keyword": "my-namespace-production"
      }
    }
  }'
```

Once the result of the search query exactly fits what you want to delete, carry on to the next step.

## Delete by query

A `POST` request against the `_delete_by_query` endpoint will delete all documents matching the query in the request's body.

If we want to delete all logs from the `my-namespace-production` from 01/02/2021:

```
awscurl --service es \
  --region eu-west-2 \
  -XPOST "https://search-cp-live-app-logs-jywwr7het3xzoh5t7ajar4ho3m.eu-west-2.es.amazonaws.com/live_kubernetes_cluster-2025.02.01/_delete_by_query" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "query": {
      "match": {
        "kubernetes.namespace_name.keyword": "my-namespace-production"
      }
    }
  }'
```

Here again, `.keyword` is essential.

## Removing specific logs filtered by phrase

If you want to delete log entries which contain a certain phrase, you can use the queries below.

Searching for the phrase "What is your name?" between certain dates, the `curl` command would look like:

```
awscurl --service es \
  --region eu-west-2 \
  -XGET "https://search-cp-live-app-logs-jywwr7het3xzoh5t7ajar4ho3m.eu-west-2.es.amazonaws.com/live_kubernetes_cluster-2*/_search" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "query": {
      "bool": {
        "must": [],
        "filter": [
          {
            "multi_match": {
              "type": "phrase",
              "query": "What is your name?",
              "lenient": true
            }
          },
          {
            "range": {
              "@timestamp": {
                "format": "strict_date_optional_time",
                "gte": "2025-03-13T12:19:24.804Z",
                "lte": "2025-04-14T15:19:24.804Z"
              }
            }
          }
        ],
        "should": [],
        "must_not": []
      }
    }
  }'

```

Deleting the log entries which have the phrase "What is your name?" between certain dates, the `awscurl` command would look like this:

```
awscurl --service es \
  --region eu-west-2 \
  -XPOST "https://search-cp-live-app-logs-jywwr7het3xzoh5t7ajar4ho3m.eu-west-2.es.amazonaws.com/live_kubernetes_cluster-2*/_delete_by_query" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "query": {
      "bool": {
        "must": [],
        "filter": [
          {
            "multi_match": {
              "type": "phrase",
              "query": "What is your name?",
              "lenient": true
            }
          },
          {
            "range": {
              "@timestamp": {
                "format": "strict_date_optional_time",
                "gte": "2025-03-13T12:19:24.804Z",
                "lte": "2025-04-14T15:19:24.804Z"
              }
            }
          }
        ],
        "should": [],
        "must_not": []
      }
    }
  }'

```

If you have complex search patterns used in OpenSearch which you want to delete,
 - narrow down the search in the webconsole
 - click on "Inspect"
 - In the popup search window, click on the tab "Request"
 - Copy and paste the object which mentions `"query": {` to the above curl command and modify dates as needed

> If you are searching for phrases which contain single-quote characters, those will need special handling when adding the phrases to the query

### Deleting documents stored in warm storage

The documents can only be deleted from indices that are in hot storage. Currently past 14 days data are in hot storage.
Once the indices are moved to warm/cold storage, you cannot delete particular documents as they are set as read-only.
You can move the indices from warm to hot storage and then delete the documents. Follow the steps below to perform this operation.

Go to kibana -> [Dev Tools](https://kibana.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/_plugin/kibana/app/dev_tools#/console)

For example, if you want to delete the index `live_kubernetes_ingress-2023.03.02`, run the following command

```bash
POST _ultrawarm/migration/live_kubernetes_ingress-2023.03.02/_hot
```

This will move the index to hot storage. You can check the status of the migration using the following command

```bash
GET _ultrawarm/migration/live_kubernetes_ingress-2023.03.02
```

Once the migration is complete, you can delete the documents using the procedure mentioned at the [beginning of this runbook](/remove-data-from-opensearch.html#delete-by-query).

Once the documents are deleted, you can move the indices back to warm storage using the following command

```bash
POST _ultrawarm/migration/live_kubernetes_ingress-2023.03.02/_warm
```

**NOTE:** If you are planning to move a lot of warm indices to hot, make sure you have enough storage in hot storage.
