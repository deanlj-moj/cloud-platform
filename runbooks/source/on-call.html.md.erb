# Going on call

Cloud Platform team members provide support out of hours, as detailed in [Cloud Platform Operational Processes](https://user-guide.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/reference/operational-processes.html#our-on-call-process).

## What’s expected?

### Expected:

* Carry out [well-defined sensible actions](https://dsdmoj.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PLAT/pages/297533847/Run+Books) in response to critical incidents.
* Understand how to carry out those actions, and what they do.
* Verify access ahead of time to various systems and interfaces required to carry out these actions.

> Getting set up to access production is quite involved if you don't work on the service you're supporting, so it's worth making sure you've done so ahead of time.

### Not expected:

* Take heroic actions and be able to solve any out-of-hours critical event single handedly.
* Have very detailed knowledge of every nuance of every MOJ Digital service.
* Carrying out risky activities or take judgement calls beyond your comfort zone without support.

## Where do I start?

1. Do two rotations on in-hours second line.
2. Get production access to supported services.
3. Get access to our on-call tools:
    * [Pingdom](https://my.pingdom.com/)
    * [Pagerduty- moj-digital-tools.pagerduty.com](https://identity.pagerduty.com/global/authn/authentication/PagerDutyGlobalLogin/subdomain) (and configure your contact details and notifications, this is the single source of truth for when you are on call.)
    * [AWS](https://mojdsd.signin.aws.amazon.com/)
    * the MOJDS VPN (and configure it to “send all traffic over VPN connection”)
4. Do a dry-run of an incident.
5. Get on the on-call rota.
6. Log your hours.

## What do I get for being on call?

* 15% of day rate for every 8 hours that you’re on call out of standard working hours. This payment is simply for being on call.
* 1/8 of day rate for each full hour actively worked while on call.

Civil servant equivalent of day rate is base salary / 230.

## Civil servants

1. Complete the [SOPHR143 on-call-form](https://moj.myhub.sscl.com/fast-forms/hr-forms/pay-and-resourcing-forms)
2. Send it to your line manager, asking them to approve and submit it to the email address on the form.

The line manager should:

1. Check the form against the [PagerDuty schedule](https://moj-digital-tools.pagerduty.com/schedules#PFX6FHX) and pay policy above. Note:
    * _There are two on-call schedules for the Cloud Platform (Primary and Secondary), so when checking against PagerDuty, you may have to check against both_
    * On-call hours: weekdays are 8 hours, weekend days and bank holidays are 15 hours ([support hours](https://user-guide.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/reference/operational-processes.html#our-on-call-process))
2. Approve the form by completing section 2 of the form.
3. Submit it to the email address on the general tab of the form, CC in the enginner on the email. 

Note: SSCL will not send a confirmation email upon successful processing of the form, nor will a SR ticket be created.
